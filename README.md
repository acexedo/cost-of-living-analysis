# ðŸ“˜Cost of Living Analysis

This project analyzes global cost-of-living data to uncover insights about affordability, price fluctuations, and economic disparities across different regions. The analysis explores factors such as housing, food, transportation, and healthcare to highlight how costs vary between cities and countries.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of cost-of-living datasets.
- Statistical and visual analysis of cost components across regions.
- Comparative insights into living standards in different locations.
- Interactive visualizations (where supported) for clearer interpretation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
